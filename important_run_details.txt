All restart backups were done to mark those years where the atmosphere restart needed perturbing.

All perturbations were done using the following script
/g/data/access/projects/access/apps/pythonlib/umfile_utils/access_cm2/perturbIC.py -s <seed> restart_dump.astart

Where <seed> was equal to 42.


Those restarts where we used a different number were:
 - restart212 --> 41


At restart 222, we updated the executable to the pr31-1 release, and also updated the values of the ocean biogeochemical parameters.

At restart 272, we updated the executable to pr31-3 release, which adds material lost via burial back to the surface ocean, maintaining long-term balance in the tracers.

At restart 352, we replaced the ALK, DIC, NO3 and O2 tracers with their values from depth indicies 15:50 with those of the restart file in /g/data/vk83/prerelease/configurations/inputs/access-esm1p6/modern/pre-industrial/restart/2024.12.10/ocean

At restart 653, we replaced the Fe tracer with values from depth indicies 15:50 with those of the restart file in /g/data/vk83/prerelease/configurations/inputs/access-esm1p6/modern/pre-industrial/restart/2024.12.10/ocean

At restart 666, we increased the scavenging of iron onto particles by an order of magnitude from kscav_dfe = 0.0001 to kscav_dfe = 0.001

At restart 678, we increased the remineralisation rate coefficient (detrem) from 0.4 to 0.5 to maintain more organics in the upper ocean, elevate productivity, but also reduce deoxygenation in the deep.
